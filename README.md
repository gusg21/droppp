# Droppp (Drop Plus Plus)

A script and C++ library combo that enables runtime type information for simple C++ classes. Currently very stupid/breakable/brittle, but should work for most cases. The C++ "parser" is very basic and limited, so beware! Look at droppp_config.json for an example of how to tell droppp where to find your code.
